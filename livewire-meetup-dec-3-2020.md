## Topics

#### Updates to Livewire,
 @liam’s contribution to the alpine entangle side

#### JSON fields manipulating them searching on them 
- using DTO’s both 
	- Spatie
	- Jess archer

#### Tall Forms
- Updates to tall forms
- Tina has put out some “good” YouTube videos
	- These focus on using tall forms from someone with amazing skill and expertise
	- If people are using tall forms, please consider sponsoring Tina; if her work saves you hours and you are using it to make money, it’s a fair exchange, and it enables cool people to make tools that enable you to get stuff done.

- I have put up some “bad” YouTube videos.
	- These focus on using tall forms from scratch with no rehearsal. Just reading the docs and discussing the setup.
	- It does have a great way to set up your livewire environment for testing.
	- Also, all my videos are “totally cold turkey with no prep and not even a good mic.”
		- I’ll accept sponsorship towards screen casting equipment if you think you’d like to see more casts.

#### Livewire Newsletter
Liam runs a livewire newsletter; it’s awesome and useful. If you want to contribute something, please contact him.

#### Breeze Vs. Jetstream
- Discussion on what the differences were
- We didn’t dive code.
- Jetstream
	- Teams
	- Forced device logout via session and ideas on where it could be used
	- Teams are weak sauce.
	- Can only belong to one team (I haven’t verified this)
		- User->currentTeam I think people said, but if that were true, it would imply that the user could actually belong to many teams at a time but only access data for one team at a time, which for me is actually fine, and not weak sauce as it were. Will dig deeper between project; however, other people are free to discuss and improve this.
- Breeze
	- No teams.
	- No default livewire setup, not an issue takes 2 seconds, but I’ll cover that in a video.
	- Everything is published right there into your app, and it’s like laravel/ui with TailwindCSS.
